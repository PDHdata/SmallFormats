# SmallFormats

Inspired by [EDHrec][edhrec], this is a deck-stats site for [Pauper EDH][pdhhomebase] and hopefully other "smaller" (less common) Magic: the Gathering formats someday.

## Fetching data

You will need card data from Scryfall and then a two-pass crawl of Archidekt.
The `crawl` step will fetch each deck, and then the `populate` step will fetch the decklists for each deck.

```shell
./manage fetch-cards
./manage crawl-archidekt
./manage populate-archidekt --crawl-id $ID_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP
```
