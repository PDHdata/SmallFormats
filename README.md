# SmallFormats

Inspired by [EDHrec][edhrec], this is a deck-stats tool for [Pauper EDH][pdhhomebase] and hopefully other "smaller" (less common) Magic: the Gathering formats someday.
It was built to power [PDHdata][pdhdata], which is a deck-stats site specifically for PDH.

## Running your own

### Naming
This software is offered to you under the [MIT license](LICENSE).
That means you may use some or all of it to run your own project.
However, you don't have the right to the name `SmallFormats` or `PDHdata`.
You'll need to set an environment variable `SMALLFORMATS_NAME` or edit the config in `smallformats/settings.py` to whatever you're choosing to call your project.

### Database setup
_Unlike_ many Django projects, this one doesn't use SQLite locally.
We depend on several Postgres-specific features (materialized views, JSON field features, etc.).
While we **love** SQLite, it was becoming burdensome to support dev-only hacks mirroring Postgres features.
So as of now, we only support [Postgres](https://postgresql.org).
At time of writing (2024-11-26), we're using Postgres 15 in production.

For local dev work on my Mac, I've found [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/) to work well.
You can either create a database called `pdhdev` or pass a `DATABASE_URL` with appropriate details every time you call `./manage`.

### Initial setup
It's a Django project managed with uv. For local dev, it's mostly the usual cycle of commands (though I've added a `./manage` shell script so you can avoid typing `uv run ./manage.py` all the time).


```shell
uv sync
./manage migrate
./manage createsuperuser
./manage runserver
```

### Fetching data
You will need card data from Scryfall and then a two-pass crawl of Archidekt.
The `crawl` step will fetch each deck, and then the `populate` step will fetch the decklists for each deck.

```shell
./manage fetch-cards
./manage crawl-archidekt
./manage populate-archidekt --crawl-id $ID_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP
```

To fetch from Moxfield, you'll need to ask them nicely.
If approved, they'll set you up with an API key in the form of a specific user-agent.
Put your API key into the `SMALLFORMATS_MOXFIELD_USERAGENT` variable, otherwise you'll get a 403.

### Deploying to production
That part is up to you!

An incomplete list of steps required:
- Get a fly.io account
- Run Postgres in that fly.io account
- Deploy the app
- Set the `DATABASE_URL` and `SMALLFORMATS_MOXFIELD_USERAGENT` secrets
- Set the `FLY_API_HOST` and `FLY_API_TOKEN` secrets
