# SmallFormats

Inspired by [EDHrec][edhrec], this is a deck-stats site for [Pauper EDH][pdhhomebase] and hopefully other "smaller" (less common) Magic: the Gathering formats someday.

## Running your own

### Naming
This software is offered to you under the [MIT license](LICENSE).
That means you may use some or all of it to run your own project.
However, you don't have the right to the name `SmallFormats`.
You'll need to set an environment variable `SMALLFORMATS_NAME` or edit the config in `smallformats/settings.py` to whatever you're choosing to call your project.

### Initial setup
It's a Django project managed with Poetry. For local dev, it's mostly the usual cycle of commands (though I've added a `./manage` shell script so you can avoid typing `poetry run ./manage.py` all the time)

```shell
poetry install
./manage migrate
./manage createsuperuser
./manage runserver
```

### Fetching data
You will need card data from Scryfall and then a two-pass crawl of Archidekt.
The `crawl` step will fetch each deck, and then the `populate` step will fetch the decklists for each deck.

```shell
./manage fetch-cards
./manage crawl-archidekt
./manage populate-archidekt --crawl-id $ID_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP
```

### Deploying to production
That part is up to you!
