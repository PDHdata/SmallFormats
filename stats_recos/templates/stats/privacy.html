<h1>Privacy and terms of use</h1>
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>
  {{ SITENAME }} doesn't want your personal data.
  We don't store any information about you, and we don't (currently) have personalized features which would require knowing anything about you.
  We don't even set any cookies unless you log in.
  And only administrators of the site can log in, so that <i>very</i> likely doesn't apply to you!
</p>
<h2>Terms of use</h2>
<p>
  {{ SITENAME }} exists for the benefit of the PDH community.
  Please don't use this site, our GitHub page, or anything else connected to {{ SITENAME }} to harass other people or abuse other sites.
  Wizards of the Coast makes their IP available under a pretty generous <a href="https://company.wizards.com/fancontentpolicy">Fan Content Policy</a>; don't abuse that either.
